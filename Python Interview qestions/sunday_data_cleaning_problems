üß© ALL PROBLEM STATEMENTS
===========================

1. First Non-Repeating Character:
   - Given a string, return the first character that does not repeat. If all characters repeat, return None.

2. Flatten a Nested List:
   - Write a function that flattens a list which may contain nested lists of arbitrary depth.

3. Group Words by Anagram:
   - Given a list of words, group them into sets of anagrams.

4. Longest Consecutive Sequence:
   - Given an unsorted list of integers, return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.

5. SQL-style Filter Function:
   - Filter a list of dicts where a specific column has a given value, like a SQL WHERE clause.

6. SUMIF Logic in Python:
   - Write a function that sums a column‚Äôs value only when a condition column matches a given value.

7. Log Parser:
   - Extract and return log entries that are marked with the level [ERROR].

8. API Response Cleaner:
   - From a list of dicts (mock API response), remove any entries missing required keys: "email" and "name".

9. Normalize Nested Order Data:
   - Flatten nested order records into row-level line items that include order ID, customer, item, and date.

10. Filter Orders from Last N Days:
    - Return only the orders that fall within the last N days from today using the order‚Äôs "YYYY-MM-DD" date field.
